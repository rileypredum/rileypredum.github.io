          rpm is a commitment to the study of the self. It was formed in the variegated topographies of California, Arizona, Utah, and Colorado, during a formative time in my life exploring most of 2021 with my mountain bike. The only constant in my life has been asking myself what I want to do to improve my situation, and revelations honor that tradition. In these revelations I believe we find stillness in the settled dust, and an unwavering sense of who we are and who we want to become.

          I'm a (multi)disciplined artist who hears woodwinds in the woods and BPMs in wheeled revolutions. I'm interested in observing the multifarious ways we engage and disengage with both indoor and outdoor spaces and faces. There is power in and out of doors, natural or engineered, to shift perspectives and root us in experiences. My makings and doings stem from those beliefs and I intend to inspire and challenge people to grow by exploring them.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I try to encourage others to engage intentionally wherever and with whomever they find themselves. For me, pedaling my bike into distant open earth has always given me the width to see selves. I love biking but internalized external pressure and socially taught metrics made mince meat of the magic I fell in love with. I’ve worked hard since 2020 to rediscover this love. I believe that, once we know what acts gives us joy, exhilaration, pensiveness, and purpose, we must carve out moments for them.

          We can commit to forever turning the dials of our own habitus, reconstructing histories and patternings that don't go to work for us. This brings us novel views of the old and the curiosity and calm to (re)discover the new.

                rpm is a commitment - to pay homage to and seek growth - and an exploration of the indoor and outdoor spaces that enabled that growth for me. I intend for my creations to challenge or inspire myself and you to grow in the ways that bring us closer to home, starting from the inside out.

                This website is the home of various art pieces across the different media I find myself inspired by.

                These pieces are their own living creations. All of the works deeply affect and ground me. They have all had an immensely positive impact on my life.

              <p style="padding-top: 5%; font-size: 12px;">
                I wonder if, by experiencing them, you will observe a similarly positive shift in yourself.
